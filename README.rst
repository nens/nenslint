nenslint: check and update your projects
==========================================

Nenslint is both a "lint" tool that tells you what's wrong with your project's
setup *and* a helper tool that helps you fix it up.

**Goal**: make it easy to bring your project up-to-date without having to know
details about many different aspects of our project setup. Who knows
everything about buildout? i18n setup details? This script should know *and
document it*.

**Basic usage**: call it and it'll spit out improvements it finds. Extra commands
are available for help in fixing it up.

(When you develop on nenslint, see the developer documentation in the sphinx docs).
